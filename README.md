# Fish Behaviour
FishBiv is an application that is used to:

•	Recognize the locomotor of zebra fish larvae after being exposed to neurotoxic substances using Convolution Neural Network (CNN).
•	Understand the molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson’s Disease (PD) by generating animal models of PD using zebrafish.

Objectives:
- To develop an algorithm for locomotor activity recognition of zebrafish larvae using CNN.
- To validate the proposed algorithm on the recognition of the locomotor activity of the zebrafish larvae.
- To evaluate the performance of reginition by the experts.
