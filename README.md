# Fish Behaviour
FishBiv is an application that is used to recognize the locomotor of zebra fish larvae after being exposed to toxic substances using Convolution Neural Network (CNN).
Video Processing used is OpenCV.

Objectives:
- To develop an algorithm for locomotor activity recognition of zebrafish larvae using CNN.
- To validate the proposed algorithm on the recognition of the locomotor activity of the zebrafish larvae.
- To evaluate the performance of reginition by the experts.
